# simple_inverse_conduction

first i have to say this was put on ice since my supervicor didn't whnt me to publish this.
though. I no longer work there and i'm free to do as I like.

This is a simple way to compute the inverse of heat conduction as done in *insert academic paper here*.

I will come back to this.
